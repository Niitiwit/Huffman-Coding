This test.txt is the sample file using in presentation of Huffman coding file compression and decompression
The Huffman coding using Greedy Method Algorithm to implement the lossless files compression by using the count
of same alphabet and transform them into binary number then add it into the Huffman tree to give them-
the position as 0 or 1 the head node will be 0 and parents add 0 and 1 and children node will be 0 and 1 and so on
Till all alphabet getting the binary after that the lossless compression will be performed as that
